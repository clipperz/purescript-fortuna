# purescript-fortuna

TENTATIVE implementation of the Fortuna PRNG in PureScript.

The idea is to port Clipperz previous implementation to PureScript, but we still need to learn a lot of stuff before considering this useful.

At the moment it is just a proof of concept, added here just to be able to share it between people interested in working on it.
